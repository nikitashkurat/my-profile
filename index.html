					<p>
						I'm Ukrainian and I'm 19 years old. I was born and raised in Greece, then in Ukraine. After completing a French school in Kyiv, I began my studies at ESSEC Business School, in the first year of their undergraduate program. I speak 5 languages and am currently studying a 6th one at university. I'm passionate about history, geopolitics, technology and music and I love finding out new things about these topics.

				<h2><strong>Cooking</strong></h2>
					<p>
						It's relaxing. It lets me concentrate on this one thing for the time being without worrying about other stuff. In addition, it's very satisfying as you're trying to achieve a result.

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2><strong>Listening to music</strong></h2>
					<p>
						As for the previous one, it's also relaxing. In addition, I like to discover new artists and I usually just get lost in my music and it makes me feel good.
					</p>

			<div class="card-white">
				<h2><strong>Walking</strong></h2>
					<p>
						Walking is productive for me. It helps me either concentrate on something, or forget about a topic that's stuck in my head and can't get out. Especially with music in my ears, I really enjoy walking, regardless of the time of the day.
